# UFOs

## Objective
Build a webpage with a dynamic table in which users are able to filter the UFO sightings data by variables such as date, city, state, country and shape, creating a quick visualization of the results.

## Results
The webpage is functional. To conduct a search, the user would have to utilize the filtered search categories. The user must use the format suggested in each filter box. When the user is done adding all the desired condition they simply press enter and the page will refresh.

## Summary

### Drawbacks
Filters may not be dynamic enough. Variations in reporting data may cause them to by missed by our format dependent filtration system.

### Recommendations
- Update the filtration system to incorporate a drop-down option. This would assist in limiting missed date due to input error.

- Update the filtration system with a trim function to catching leading and trailing spaces in input data.
